Badminton Academy Project

*UNDER PROGRESS*

This is a project I have recently uptook as a request from the owner of a nearby badminton academy. The software will have to 
connect with the banking services in order to receive and send all payments and store all the information in a neat and organised
financial ledger. The software will also store all the necessary student and staff information, with a new and inmproved
GUI(as compared to the hostel software I have uploaded here). I am currently working on this project, and as always anyone 
is free to download it and use any code they wish for their own projects :)
